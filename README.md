## Data Science Projects:

### [Rossmann Store - Forescasting Sales](https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/RossmannStore)
  * Currently, knowing how much your company will bill in the coming weeks would change your decisions?
 This project aims to use machine learning techniques to forecast sales in the next 6 weeks of a store called Rossmann.
 The XGBoost algorithm was used, obtaining a MAPE of 15%.
 The performance of this model would bring revenue of $ 277 million according to the company's business model described in the problem definition.
  * Repository: https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/RossmannStore

### [Cardio Catch Diseases - Prediction of Cardiovascular Diseases](https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/Cardio-Catch-Diseases---Predicting-Cardiovascular-Diseases)
  * Building a Machine Learning Model to detect cardiovascular disease in early stages leverage the diagnostic precision made by health professionals.
In this project, I developed a Machine Learning model able to detect disease in early stages with 75% accuracy over 70k patience.
The performance of this model would increase revenue of U$175 millions according to the company's business model described in the problem definition.

### [Blocker Fraud Company - Fraud Detection](https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/fraud_detection)
  * Machine Learning and taking fraud detection to the next level. Companies are reducing their costs with detecting fraudulent transactions, while companies providing theses types of services are increasing thier income.
In this project, I built a Machine Learning classifier to label fraudulent transactions with 99.7% of accuracy.
The performance of this model would bring revenue of U$898 millions according to the company's business model described in the problem definition.

### [House Prices - Regression Problem](https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/house_prices)
  * Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers. In this project, house prices will be predicted given explanatory variables that cover many aspects of residential houses. The goal of this project is to create a regression model that are able to accurately estimate the price of the house given the features
  The Random Forest Regressor algorithm was used, obtaining a MAPE of 7%..

### [Health Insurance Predict](https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/health_insurance)
  * This project aims to make the company "Insurance Health" profit more. This company provides health insurance to its customers and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering policyholders a new product: auto insurance. Therefore, a machine learning model was built that detects customers interested in the services. The ExtraTreesClassifier model was used, which obtained the best performance from the cumulative gain curve and lift curve metrics, to solve the problem.
